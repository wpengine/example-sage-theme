An example of how write beautiful and modern templates, with modern CI/CD practices using github actions and the Roots/Sage theme using [wpengine.com](https://wpengine.com)

To produce beautiful themes like
```blade
<a class="sr-only focus:not-sr-only" href="#main">
  {{ __('Skip to content') }}
</a>

<div class="flex flex-col h-screen">
  <div>
    @include('sections.header')
  </div>

  <main id="main" class="w-full max-w-6xl px-4 mx-auto mt-6 mb-auto">
    @yield('content')
  </main>

  @include('sections.footer')
</div>
```

## To get started
You can either [clone and modify this repo](#clone-this-repo) as a starter or [copy these steps to recreate a fresh install on your own](docs/fresh.md).

## Clone this repo

1. First clone this repo with a sage theme
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wpengine/example-sage-theme <wordpress-dir>
cd <wordpress-dir>
```

2. Now, update the github action to use your info
```bash
vi .github/workflows/action.yml

# Edit this section
name: Deploy to WP Engine
env:
  WPE_SSHG_KEY_PRIVATE: ${{ secrets.WPE_SSHG_KEY_PRIVATE }} # Don't change this, leave the SSH key a secret
  WPE_INSTALL_NAME: your-wp-install-name
  THEME_NAME: your-roots-theme-name-here
```

3. Setup a new ssh private key in GithHub and WP Engine via https://wpengine.com/support/github-action-deploy/#Setup_Instructions

4. Push the repo to your own GitHub and the [post-deploy.sh](post-deploy.sh) will clear the cache during [GitHub deploys](.github/workflows/action.yml#L55-L58) ðŸŽ‰.

## Frequently Asked Questions
- I thought WP Engine doesn't support Sage/Roots theme?
  - Sage was never fully supported due to the way Sage out of the box conflicted with our security best practices. In late 2022, we started to make changes to fully support pre-compiling Sage templates to enable official support if they follow the way this repo deploys with [`post-deploy.sh`](https://github.com/wpengine/example-sage-theme/blob/main/post-deploy.sh) script, that ultimately runs `wp acorn view:cache`.
- Sage wasn't supported until late 2022?
  - There have been ways of running Sage on WP Engine prior using customization or other means, but this approach is our offically supported way.
- What about Timber/Twig themes?
  - Those themes are also supported! Just [disable filesystem caching](https://timber.github.io/docs/guides/hosts-servers/#wordpress-vip) and let our other, more advanced, caching mechanisms take the place of that.
- Why not just disable filesystem caching on Sage the same way?
  - That's probably another great alternative, but it requires more effort/customization then many of our customers want, if that is a route you want to go, please be sure to let our support team know when you've made progress there and we'd love to add docs on how to accomplish that as well!
